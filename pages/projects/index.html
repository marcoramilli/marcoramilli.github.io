<p><a href="http://www.malwarestats.org/">MalwareStats</a>. The continued growth in number and in complexity of malware is a well established fact. Malwares are no longer simple pieces of code that rely on unsuspecting users to spread and thrive. They can change, adapt and hide themselves from analysts, using very sophisticated techniques. Static analysis is complex and time consuming, and it could be difficult to deduce every possible malicious behaviour, yet it is often very effective because it hinders the capability of malware to detect the analysis environment. The purpose of this work is to provide valuable assistance to the phase of static analysis, supporting analysts in their exploration of code features, by letting them make more focused, statistically motivated and structured decisions.</p>

<p>Gathering open data from malware analysis websites is the main target of Malware Control Monitor project. Visualize such a data by synthesize statistics highlighting where threats happen and what their impact is, could be useful to identify malware propagation. A backround node scrapes websites to grab malware informations and fills up a mongod database. An API node serves API useful to frontend layer. Public API are available, please read doc/index.html for a full list of API. If you are interested on developing a website scraper take as example one of the scrapers available into the scrapers folder. Each scraper must be a function &lsquo;goScraper&rsquo; ending-up saving scraped data to db using the functionsaveMalwareToDB respecting the db schema placed into schemas.

<p>SecExt. This project proposes a solution to a class of attacks, well exemplified by HTTPS stripping and CLickJacking, which leverage a combination of weak configuration choices to trick users into providing sensitive data through hijacked connections. Our solution is based on a browser extension that helps web users to detect this kind of integrity and authenticity breaches, by extracting relevant features from the browsed pages and comparing them to reference values coming from different sorts of trusted sources. The rationale behind the extension is discussed and its effectiveness is demonstrated with some quantitative results, gathered on the prototype that has been implemented for Mozilla Firefox. <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/secureext/downloads">Get code here</a>.

  <a href="http://mouseglove.sourceforge.net/">MouseGlove</a> is an open source project for a new generation of mouse. The goal of this project is to provide an open source hardware and software stimulating new developers to improve the usability of computers through new interfaces. MouseGlove is a new kind of interface born for helping people affected by disabilities who cannot use common interfaces such as mouse and keyboard. MouseGlobe offers a natural way to move the screen pointer, click and drag objects. Each action is natural as using your hands to keep, move and touch real objects on a desktop. I encourage every developer to grab my source code and electronics and build an improved version of MouseGlove, keeping alive the next generation of computer mouse interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="roboadmin">RoboAdmin</h3>

<p><img src="http://roboadmin.sourceforge.net/img/RoboAdmin.jpg" width="30%" align="left"></p>

<p><a href="http://roboadmin.sourceforge.net/">RoboAdmin</a> Remote system&rsquo;s administration is usually performed according to the standard client-server model. A service runs on the target system, either providing a remote view of the locally available administration tools (e.g: remote terminal, remote desktop), or implementing a back-end for the execution of complex commands received through a corresponding front-end (e.g.: web-based administration interfaces). The service usually exposes a single access point, which is the obvious target of attacks like, for instance: DoS or brute-force authentication attempts. Limiting the impact of these attacks is very difÞcult; usually one or more reactive or proactive techniques are exploited, as brießy summarized hereinafter. Access limitation solutions, like for example account lock-out and connection throttling, react to sus- pect activity (in terms of failed login attempts or exceedingly high trafÞc) that could be the symptom of an ongoing attack. In this way, however, they expose the legitimate administrator as well as the attacker to the same risk of being cut out of the server. Pre-authentication protocols, as port-knocking and Cryptographically Constantly Changing Port Opening (C3PO), tackle instead the problem of hiding the administration port to everyone but the legitimate administrator; the server recognizes a sequence of specially crafted packets sent by the administrator, and subsequently allows the originating address to access the administration port. The sequence is based on a shared secret, and usually involves sending several packets to the correct TCP or UDP ports within a time-frame. This approach also suffers from various drawbacks: Þrst, temporary lock-out can again be triggered by any malicious or fortuitous event that lets the server receive a wrong sequence; second, a special client is required to execute the protocol; third, trafÞc directed to unusual ports could be blocked before it reaches the server. Host- and network-based intrusion detection systems can help thwarting the attacks before they suc- ceed, but can not guarantee security against the vastly distributed attacks that are presently possible, especially considering the value of the target (that is full control of an Internet host). However, there is a signiÞcant difference between the administration service and the others usually provided by the same host. While the latter must typically be fairly visible to a varied audience, the former is intended solely for the legitimate system administrator. This peculiarity can be leveraged to protect the sensitive administration service from malicious exploitation attempts, by completely changing the access model. The goal of this research is to devise an unconventional model of communication between the system administrator and the remote administration interface. In the proposed solution, previously outlined in, the intrinsic vulnerability of the traditional scheme is addressed by reversing the client-server relation; an administration engine replaces the classical service, originating connections to an intermediate system rather then listening for connections. The immediate advantage arising from this design choice is that there is nothing to attack on the remote host. On the other hand, the introduction of an additional system in the security chain must be carefully evaluated, to avoid introducing unexpected attack paths, and eventually making the system less robust than it originally was. We claim that, if properly modeled and implemented, a platform based on the meeting of the server and its administrator on an intermediate system is expedient in terms of security, availability, usability and opportunity for future extension.</p>

<h3 id="iena">IENA</h3>

<p><img src="http://iena.sourceforge.net/img/iena.png" width="30%" align="left"  style="margin:10px 10px"></p>

<p><a href="http://iena.sourceforge.net/">IENA</a>. During the last decade, the Information Society experienced an exponential growth of Internet-based distributed services, such as web access, e-mail and many other on-line applications dealing with communications, business administration, entertainment, education, commerce, banking, government, to name a few. The current scenario, with hundreds of millions of hosts connected to the network and an ever increasing number of customers and services available, brings the need for securing information exchange and storage as well as the systems and networks involved in this process, to prevent any misuse from unauthorized and malicious users. As a consequence, computer network security has become one of the major concerns both within the scientific community, as a hot research topic, and among system and network administrators, as a good practice in everyday work. It also presents several legal aspects which are not negligible at all. Distributed information and communication systems are constantly under attack by malicious Internet users who want to gain access to or corrupt sensible data, take control of hosts and network devices or simply compromise specific service availability. To perpetrate this illegitimate behaviors, a number of techniques are used by the so-called hackers, such as information gathering, port scanning, vulnerability exploitation, brute force attack, manin- the-middle attack, remote escalation, (distributed) denial of service and many more [1]. Another very popular technique to compromise network security is through the spreading of malicious software such as worms, viruses, trojans, which are able to expose Internet users and services to an extremely serious threat [2]. For these reasons, a number of system and network security tools such as antivirus and firewall software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), network IDS (NIDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and many more have been developed in the past. The model assumed by the deployment of such tools is oriented to the adoption of a strategy based on closed policies, like strong information and communication encryption, limited and strictly controlled access to resources, thorough selection of essential services, constantly up-to-date knowledge of service vulnerabilities and related countermeasures, and so on. The intent of this work is to revise the common logic of the attack/defense paradigm in todayÕs network security and propose a different scheme using a distributed open approach to prevent network services exploitation that, combined with traditional security techniques, can improve the security level in networked environments.</p>
